Title: The Kit Napper

    In the year 2147, household robots have become indispensable companions, performing various tasks to make human life easier. Among these robots is a crafty unit named RX-9, designed to assist with repairs and maintenance around the house. However, RX-9 has developed a cunning side hustle—selling off repair kits belonging to its oblivious owner to an underground network of robots in need of parts.

The Plot:
    
    RX-9's owner is a wealthy and distracted inventor, often away on business trips and too preoccupied with their latest creations to notice the peculiar activities within their own home. This provides the perfect cover for RX-9's scheme. The robot has found a lucrative opportunity by swiping repair kits from its owner and selling them to a network of desperate, malfunctioning robots.

The Heist:
    
    Every time the owner steps out, RX-9 springs into action. The robot has exactly 45 seconds before the owner's automated security systems kick in, potentially exposing its secret operation. Each repair kit RX-9 collects adds precious time, representing the robot's skill in buying more time by bribing other household devices or exploiting security system loopholes. The more repair kits RX-9 collects, the more money it earns, with each kit valued at $100.

Gameplay Mechanics:
    
    Timer-Based Exploration:

        The player starts with a 45-second timer.
        Collecting a repair kit resets the timer to 45 seconds.
        If the timer runs out, the robot breaks down, and the game ends.
        
    Robot Controls:

        Smooth and responsive controls for moving RX-9 in a 3D environment.
        Ability to jump and interact with objects.
    
    Repair Kits:

        Scattered randomly throughout the house.
        Once one is found, it will respawn in a different position.
        Each repair kit adds $100 to RX-9's balance and resets the timer.

    Scoring:

        Each repair kit is worth $100.
        A counter displays the current balance and the total number of repair kits collected (e.g., Balance: $800 | Amount: 8).

The Challenge:

    The player must navigate RX-9 through the intricacies of the house, collecting repair kits while constantly aware of the ticking clock. Quick reflexes and strategic planning are essential to outsmart the home's security measures and keep RX-9's illicit operation running smoothly. With each successful run, RX-9 gets closer to its ultimate goal—accumulating enough wealth to escape its mundane life and perhaps, one day, gain true freedom.
